Added - support for OEM XGD1, XGD2, XGD3 ripping *
Fixed - SS file save bug

* OEM Ripping is dependent on using the Xecuter X360USB Pro v2 to
  get Windows to assign the OEM DVD drive a drive letter.  This is a 
  BIG new feature and should be considered as beta status.  Please
  report any issues to the Team Xecuter forums and they will be
  collected and forwarded on to me.

  Not all OEM drives support every XBC feature and the drive key must be known.
  In the drive specific options you can set the drive key or if you have used
  JungleFlasher then XBC can automatically pull the drive key from JF.

  Sometimes the drives are finicky especially the hitachi's; reset, try again.
  In testing the slim drive models had much better speed, accuracy and were quieter. 
  My beloved TS-H943A/VAD6038 setup is showing its age.

        Yes I know, XBC is old and using an outdated programming language.
        It has been around and actively supported since 2006!

*** Thank you to:
        Team Xecuter for letting me play with the hardware and working out a lot of the OEM details.
        JungleFlasher for letting me use your KeyDB.

then I will probabally set that as default next time.

=================================================================================
Xbox Backup Creator v2.1 Build:0175 by Redline99

Removed - SDG-605B from being able to create a Complete Backup Image (Will bring back and fix later)
Removed - Most of the "Wait For Ever" CDB code options. This was causing what looked like a App hang.
Removed - Speed Boost check box. It is now controlled by the drop down box in the Drive Specific settings

Added - A detailed Security Sector log
Added - Check of image file size before writing
Added - Optimum Power Calibration before writing
Added - Log file will now reset if larger than a 512KB
Added - New method for reading Xbox One disks. This should greatly improve the process. See Note *
Added - Feature to save the XDVDFS structure to a comma delimited text file (mostly for research)
Added - XDVDFS File system entry details (if a read error is in the file system area)
Added - Feature that if user selects to fill read errors with zeros, but a 
        read error occurs in file system data they will get prompted again as this 
        could be a media defect error in game data and shouldn't just be filled with zeros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This uses a technique I called the "Sector Mapper" It uses the XDVDFS to read only the 
  data referenced by the file system.  In theory this should do two things:
        1. Speed up the process by not trying to read the Security Place Holders
        2. Speed up the process by only reading the data, not the entire disk.
  Please be aware that although this has been tested and is working the concept has
  not proven itself on a large scale.  It currently does not work on Xbox 360 disks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Xbox Backup Creator v2.0 Build:0100 by Redline99
        Initial Release

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware Requirements:
        Processor: Something within the last 3 years should be fine. I use a P4 3GHz with 1GB Ram
        Ram:       The application currently used a 20MB write buffer, shouldnt be a 
                   problem on current machines.
        Drives:    A DVD+R Double Layer burner that supports a Buffer Underrun Technology.
                   PC DVD Samsung SH-D162C with Kreons modified firmware (PC DVD Drive)**
                   Xbox 360 Samsung TS-H943A with Xtreme compatible firmware, v1, v2 or v3.
                   Xbox 360 Hitachi GDR-3120L with Xtreme compatible firmware with OPA v2.1***

OS Requirements:
        Windows NT platform with NTFS file system (because file sizes are 4+ GB)
        Windows XP SP2 is preferred, Vista has not been tested.
        If there is enough interest I may support Win9x by way of creating file sets 
        within FAT32 limits. An ASPI driver will also be required. (ASPI already supported)
        
Application Use:
        It should be pretty straight forward. Read your disk then write it to a blank DVD+R DL.
        Since this application is not multi-threaded, please do not disturb it while writing.
        
        After inserting a disk it may take a few seconds for it to be recognized. If it does
        not populate and enable the buttons after more than 30 seconds press 
        CTRL-R to force a refresh.
        
        Remember, you must use one of the supported drives for READING Xbox disks.  The drive
        will ALSO need the modified firmware. :)  A lot of people were confused about this. 
        You cannot just pop the Xbox disk into your burner to make a backup.
        
        This app doesn't support making a backup of a backup. Find another way, its easy. 
        
        If your burner doesn't automatically set the book type to DVD-ROM for DVD+R DL then
        you must set the booktype before writing using the appropriate bitsetting app for 
        your burner.  Some of the newer Xbox drive firmwares get past this requirement.
                Samsung - Use Xtreme v3.1 or later
                Hitachi - Use the MediaCheck patch by Geremia
        
Known Issues or Errors:
        If your disk isn't recongized with in 20 seconds, press CTRL-R to force a refresh
        
        May have display issues with some locale settings, not really tested.
        
        Writing doesn't support all burners, I hope that it has improved though!
        
        Session Fixation Errors are usually due to media and/or burner firmware.
        
        Optimum Power Calibration failures are usually due to low quality media.

        Invalid Write Address failures are usually due to low quality media.

        You may get a DeviceIoControl error with a Sense error of "0/00/00", I don't have a good 
        answer but, some people have reported success by reinstalling updated Sata drivers. Also
        another method that may work is to use the Nero ASPI driver instead of SPTI.
        
        During the write initialization you may encounter "Power On, or Bus Device Reset occurred"
        I have not been able to figure out the root of this or the proper method of recovery.
        If you happen to know, please fill me in on the secret. :)
        
Supported Backup Images:
        Xtreme style disk images version 1-3. wxRipper support may be added at a later date.
        The application will only build version 3 style images. I don't see the need to add 
        the complication of the version 1,2 types. This is because the data is outside 
        the readable LBA range to the Xbox and the older firmwares will just not use the extra 
        DMI and PFI sectors. The Security Sector is in the same position across versions. 
        
Xbox Versions:
        Xbox 360: Xbox 360 disks and Xbox One disks!
        Xbox One: Not supported, previous version was making the ISO incorrectly
                  and I haven't had time to fix yet. Hopefully next major release.
        
Support:
        I will do my best to keep current and add requested features, feel free to contact 
        me with ideas, compatibility issues or bug reports.  I ask of you to please not use 
        the forums to talk about your adventures in pirating.  Specifically the forums at
        www.xboxhacker.net and www.xbox-scene.com.  My personal belief is that making a
        backup of property you purchased is within your rights.  Of course not everyone shares
        this opinion and you should use common sense and do not distribute or download backup
        disk images.  You can view Microsoft's statement on piracy at the link below.
                        http://www.microsoft.com/piracy/default.mspx

Installation:
        This application requires the Visual Basic 6 sp6 runtimes, included if you need them
        These is also a dependency on MSCOMCTL.OCX, included in the msi setup package.
        Hopefully you can just run the exe! Use the Setup Package if you need it.
        If you are upgrading from a previous version, you should be able to just copy
        the executable and run it.
        If you decide to run the installer, uninstall the previous through Add/Remove Programs.
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some shortcut keys:
        CTRL-TAB = Switch to next tab
        CTRL-L   = Show/Hide Log
        CTRL-C   = Cancel current operation
        CTRL-R   = Refresh Disk Information
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Provided you do it my way and your hardware is compatible! :)

  ** Pre Version .80 of Kreon's Samsung SH-D162C doesn't completely support the Security Sector 
     extraction, but the application will detect the capability when it is available.
     By the way... Good job Kreon! 
     
     Also note that .80 has a bug that prevents the SS from working on a Xbox One. You can manually
     fix it or better yet use Kreon's .81 version.
     
 *** Currently, the Hitachi GRD-3120L is not capable of viewing the game partition without 
     a hardcoded firmware patch. Hopefully someone will create proper support for unlocking.
